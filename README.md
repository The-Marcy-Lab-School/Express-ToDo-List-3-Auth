# Full Stack To-Do-List w/ Authentication

## Project Overview
The purpose of this Problem Set is to merge your work from you two previous To Do List labs. You will rebuild an MVC To-Do list using the RESTful API that you created. Instead of sending rendered templates in response to an incoming request, you will make AJAX requests to your backend, handle JSON responses, and render to-do's to the DOM.

### Project Requirements
* Your To-Do list app must handle multiple users.
* Users must register with a username and a password.
* Users should be able to login with a username and password.
* Each user has their own To-Do List, to which they can create, update, view, and delete tasks.
* User must be able to logout and be redirected back to the login screen.

2. Update this README so that instead of project directions, it houses the documentation for your project. It can be very simple. [Here's an example](https://github.com/emtes/assignment-todo-list) from Enmanuel!
3. Deploy to Heroku and be sure to include the project URL in your Canvas submission.
